My take on a UEFA Super League

1. Go to the Wikipedia page of the UEFA Season Template and find all the leagues that are active and add a link in the todo file
2. Run the script new-season-builder on the previous season and save the result in a new file
3. Run the script table-sorter to check the number of teams in each Division is correct
4. Add links to the homepage and previous season
5. Loop through the active leagues and add the teams with the mcr script
6. Check teams that are missing and update accordingly
7. Run table-sorter to get the final positions, pasting the result into the new season file
8. Run the promote-relegate script and do as informed until complete
9. Add a record of the winner to the winners file
10. Go to the previous season and run the season-record script, adding it to the record file
11. Commit the season to Git
