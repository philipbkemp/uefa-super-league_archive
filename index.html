		<h1>UEFA Super League</h1>
		<p>The UEFA Super League is something I made to see how is the best league team in Europe. Starting with the first recognised season of football (the 1888/89 English Football League) and working up to today, teams are ranked in a league system that combines the top flight of every nation under UEFA. Some notes about the league:</p>
		<strong>Rules and Notes</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>To make the leagues consistent, wins are always worth 3 points, and a draw 1 point.</li>
			<li>To avoid favouring teams in larger leagues (where more points are available due to more matches being played), teams are ranked by Points Per Game.</li>
			<li>In the case of a tie, teams will then be ranked by Goals Per Game.</li>
			<li>The league (when big enough) will be split into Divisions, with each Division having a maximum of 20 teams.</li>
			<li>Once large enough, 3 teams will be relegated/promoted between the Divisions - either the lowest 3, or 3 teams who are relegated from the national top flight, or a combination thereof. If more than 3 teams are relegated (due to relegation from their national top flight), the same number of teams will be promoted to cover them.</li>
			<li>Teams relegated from their national top flight will be removed from the League. If they are promoted again, they will rejoin the League in the first available space.</li>
			<li>All new or rejoining Teams will be sorted by the usual tie break rules and then placed into the available Divisions in that order.</li>
			<li>Any Team who has points deducted by their national association will have the same points deducation added in this League.</li>
			<li>Playoff matches to decide if a Team is relegated, or other matches outside the normal League season, are not counted, unless otherwise noted.</li>
		</ul>
