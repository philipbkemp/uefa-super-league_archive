		<h1>UEFA Super League</h1>
		<p>The UEFA Super League is something I made to see how is the best league team in Europe. Starting with the first recognised season of football (the 1888/89 English Football League) and working up to today, teams are ranked in a league system that combines the top flight of every nation under UEFA. Some notes about the league:</p>
		<strong>Rules and Notes</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>To make the leagues consistent, wins are always worth 3 points, and a draw 1 point.</li>
			<li>To avoid favouring teams in larger leagues (where more points are available due to more matches being played), teams are ranked by Points Per Game.</li>
			<li>In the case of a tie, teams will then be ranked by Goals Per Game, and Goal Difference</li>
			<li>The league (when big enough) will be split into Divisions, with each Division having a maximum of 40 teams.</li>
			<li>Five teams will be promoted/relegated between Divisions. If there are no enough Teams to earn Promotion, this number is reduced. Relegated teams are either relegated from their national top flight, or one of the lowest 5 Teams in a Division.</li>
			<li>Teams relegated from their national top flight will be removed from the League. If they are promoted again, they will rejoin the League in the first available space.</li>
			<li>All new or rejoining Teams will be sorted by the usual tie break rules and then placed into the available Divisions in that order.</li>
			<li>Any Team who has points deducted by their national association will have the same points deducation added in this League.</li>
			<li>Playoff matches to decide if a Team is relegated, or other matches outside the normal League season, are not counted, unless otherwise noted.</li>
			<li>Some leagues were active before they are incorporated into this League, however they were either unofficial, run as a cup-style tournament, or run in multiple regional groups. This League only considers nationwide leagues.</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>Season Tables Key</strong>

			<li>New clubs appearing in their first season have a <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></li>
